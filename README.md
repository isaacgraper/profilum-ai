ProfiumAI is a software that analyzes the investor's profile through a questionnaire, identifies the assets they own, and generates a diagnosis of how well the portfolio aligns with their profile. The system will also provide asset replacement suggestions for better alignment and a dashboard for the investor's wallet and their replacement.
